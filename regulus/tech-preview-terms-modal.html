          <p>IMPORTANT – THIS SOFTWARE IS A TECHNICAL PREVIEW, AND NOT A GENERALLY RELEASED PRODUCT. IN ADDITION, THIS LICENSE
            WILL ONLY BE IN EFFECT UNTIL AUGUST 31, 2023.</p>
          <p><strong>IMPORTANT - READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING, OR USING THE SOFTWARE. TERADATA
              WILL LICENSE THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE TO YOU ONLY IF YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND MEET
              THE CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING, OR USING THE SOFTWARE (AS APPLICABLE), YOU (1) AGREE
              TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND (2) REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU POSSESS THE AUTHORITY TO
              ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF YOU, YOUR EMPLOYER (WHEN ACTING ON BEHALF OF YOUR EMPLOYER), AND/OR A
              TERADATA-AUTHORIZED LICENSEE (WHEN YOU AND YOUR EMPLOYER ARE ACTING ON BEHALF OF A TERADATA-AUTHORIZED LICENSEE).
              IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL, DOWNLOAD, OR USE THE
              SOFTWARE.</strong></p>
          <p>This License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal contract between you (both as an individual and on behalf of your
            employer and any Teradata-authorized licensee for whom you and/or your employer is acting on their behalf) and
            Teradata Operations, Inc. ("Teradata") for the applicable Teradata software product, which consists of computer
            software code in object code form only, as well as associated media, printed materials, and online or electronic
            documentation (collectively, the “Software”). The term “Software” also includes any and all error corrections, bug
            fixes, updates, upgrades, or new versions or releases of the Software (collectively and individually,
            “Enhancements”) that Teradata may elect in its sole discretion to provide you. Teradata is under no obligation to
            provide you with Enhancements under this Agreement. By accepting this Agreement, you represent and warrant that you
            possess the authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of yourself, and/or on behalf of your employer and any
            Teradata-authorized licensee for whom you and/or your employer are acting on their behalf. As used in this
            Agreement, the terms "you", "your" and "yours" collectively and individually refer to you as an individual and to
            your employer, as well as such Teradata-authorized licensee.</p>
          <p>1. <strong>Term.</strong> This Agreement commences on the earliest date of the first download, first copying, first
            installation, or first use of the Software. This Agreement, including your license to the Software, will expire or
            terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration or termination of any applicable underlying agreement between you and
            Teradata (such as a partnership or customer agreement) or (ii) termination in accordance with the terms of this
            Agreement.</p>
          <p>2. <strong>License.</strong> Subject to your compliance with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
            only during the term of this Agreement, Teradata grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, term license to access,
            install and use the Software.</p>
          <p>The term "Third Party Software" means computer programs or modules (including their documentation) that bear the
            logo, copyright and/or trademark of a third party (including open source software that are contained in files marked
            as “open source” or the like) or are otherwise subject to written license terms of a third party. Third Party
            Software does not constitute Software. Third Party Software is licensed to you subject to the applicable license
            terms accompanying it, included in/with it, referenced in it, or otherwise entered into by you with respect to it.
          </p>
          <p>You will not sell, copy, rent, loan, modify, transfer, disclose, embed, sublicense, create derivative works of or
            distribute the Software, in whole or in part, without Teradata’s prior written consent. You are granted no rights to
            obtain or use the Software’s source code. You will not reverse-assemble, reverse compile or reverse-engineer the
            Software, except as expressly permitted by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver.
            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you do not have any license, right, or authority to subject the Software,
            in whole or in part or as part of a larger work, to any terms of any other agreement, including GNU Public Licenses.
          </p>
          <p>No license rights to the Software will be implied. The Software, which includes all copies thereof (whether in
            whole or in part), is and remains the exclusive property of Teradata and its licensors. You will ensure that all
            copies of the Software contain Teradata's and its licensors' copyright notices, as well as all other proprietary
            legends. Teradata reserves the right to inspect your use of the Software for purposes of verifying your compliance
            with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If applicable, such right will be conducted according to any audit
            provisions that might exist in an underlying agreement between you and Teradata.</p>
          <p>The Software may contain a disabling device that will prevent the Software from being used on data sets larger than
            a certain size. You agree not to: (i) use the Software on data sets larger than such or (ii) disable or circumvent
            any disabling device contained in the Software.</p>
          <p>3. <strong>Responsibilities and Support.</strong> You are responsible for the installation of the Software, as well
            as for providing data security and backup operations. This Agreement does not require Teradata to provide you with
            any Enhancements, consulting services, technical assistance, installation, training, support, or maintenance of any
            kind (collectively and individually, “Services”). To the extent that Teradata elects to provide you with any
            Services, such Services are provided to you at Teradata’s sole discretion and may be modified or discontinued at any
            time for any reason. In particular, Teradata may, at its sole discretion, provide an email address or other forum
            where you can submit questions or issues related to the Software.</p>
          <p>4. <strong>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</strong> TERADATA: (A) PROVIDES SERVICES (IF ANY), (B) LICENSES THE SOFTWARE,
            AND (C) PROVIDES THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE TO YOU HEREUNDER ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND (ORAL OR
            WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY). WITHOUT LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, THERE ARE NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
            MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. TERADATA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE,
            THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, OR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR CONFORM TO ANY SPECIFICATIONS, OR THAT THE
            OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS
            TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE SOFTWARE, THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, AND
            SERVICES.</p>
          <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS RESTRICT DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT FULLY APPLY TO YOU.</p>
          <p>5. <strong>LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY:</strong> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL TERADATA’S AND ITS LICENSORS’ TOTAL
            CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, THE SOFTWARE, AND/OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE
            (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED US$10,000; PROVIDED,
            HOWEVER, THAT THE FOREGOING WILL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS FOR (I) PERSONAL INJURY, INCLUDING DEATH, TO THE EXTENT CAUSED
            BY TERADATA'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT; OR (II) PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO TANGIBLE REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY
            TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY TERADATA'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF DIRECT DAMAGES UP
            TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER OCCURRENCE. IN NO EVENT WILL TERADATA OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
            SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, TIME, OPPORTUNITY, OR DATA,
            EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
          <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS RESTRICT LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT FULLY APPLY TO YOU.</p>
          <p>6. <strong>Government Restrictions.</strong> You agree that you will not, directly or indirectly, export or
            transmit any Software without obtaining Teradata’s prior written authorization, as well as appropriate governmental
            approvals, including those required by the U.S. Government. Use and or distribution of this software is subject to
            export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. The links below connect you to applicable
            U.S. government agencies, and their regulations, that have jurisdiction over this transaction.</p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/">http://www.bis.doc.gov/</a></br>
            <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/">http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/</a>
          </p>
          <p>By installing, downloading, or using this product, you acknowledge that this transaction is subject to applicable
            export control laws and you certify that your installation, download, use and/or subsequent distribution of this
            product is not prohibited under applicable laws and regulations.</p>
          <p>The Government’s use, duplication, or disclosure of Teradata’s commercial computer software and commercial computer
            software documentation is subject to: (a) the Restricted Rights Notice set forth in 48 C.F.R. ¶ 52.227-14 (Rights In
            Data - General); (b) Teradata’s standard commercial license rights supplemented by 48 C.F.R. ¶ 52.227-19 (Commercial
            Computer Software - Restricted Rights); and/or (c) the limited rights and license set forth 48 CFR ¶ 252.227-7015
            (Technical Data–Commercial Items), as applicable.</p>
          <p>7. <strong>Termination and Expiration.</strong> A party may terminate this Agreement with or without cause, upon
            providing written notice to the other parties. When this Agreement terminates or expires, you will immediately cease
            all use of the Software, permanently remove the Software from all computers, destroy all copies of the Software, and
            (upon receipt of Teradata’s request) provide a signed written certification that the foregoing has occurred.
            Sections 4-11 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p>
          <p>8. <strong>Choice of Law and Dispute Resolution.</strong> The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any
            controversy or claim by negotiation or mediation. If they are unable to do so, and regardless of the causes of
            action alleged and whether they arise under this Agreement or otherwise, the claim will be resolved by arbitration
            before a sole arbitrator in San Diego, California pursuant to the then-current Commercial Rules of the American
            Arbitration Association and the federal substantive and procedural law of arbitration. The arbitrator’s award will
            be final and binding, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, but may include only damages
            consistent with the limitations in this Agreement. Each party will bear its own attorney's fees and costs related to
            the arbitration. The obligations to negotiate, mediate and arbitrate shall not apply to claims for misuse or
            infringement of a party’s intellectual property rights. Any claim or action must be brought within two years after
            the claimant knows or should have known of the claim. New York law will govern the interpretation and enforcement of
            this Agreement, except that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of the
            arbitrability of claims under this Section.</p>
          <p>9. <strong>Feedback.</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary: (a) Teradata will have no obligation of any
            kind with respect to any Software-related comments, suggestions, design changes or improvements that you elect to
            provide to Teradata in either verbal or written form (collectively, “Software Feedback”), and (b) Teradata and its
            affiliates are hereby free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques, in whole or in part, contained in
            Software Feedback: (i) for any purpose whatsoever, including developing, manufacturing, and/or marketing products
            and/or services incorporating Software Feedback in whole or in part, and (ii) without any restrictions or
            limitations, including requiring the payment of any license fees, royalties, or other consideration.</p>
          <p>10. <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> You will not disclose the results of any testing or evaluations, including
            any benchmarks, insofar as it relates to the Software without Teradata’s prior written consent.</p>
          <p>11. <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement and the terms of use for the site from which you downloaded
            the Software (“General Terms of Use”) constitute the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the
            Software and Services (if any), and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings whether oral or written.
            In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the General Terms of Use, this Agreement will prevail with
            respect to the subject matter hereof. No oral representation or change to this Agreement will be binding upon either
            party unless agreed to in writing and signed by authorized representatives of all parties. You will not assign this
            Agreement or your rights, nor will you delegate your obligations under this Agreement. Failure by either party to
            enforce any term or condition of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any
            other term or condition. The provisions of this Agreement are severable. "Include", "includes", and "including"
            shall be interpreted as introducing a list of examples which do not limit the generality of any preceding words or
            any words in the list of examples.</p>
